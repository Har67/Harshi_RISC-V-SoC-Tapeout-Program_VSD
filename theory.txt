PRE-SYNTHESIS SIMULATION -Testing RTL code directly
Why Important: Verify logical functionality before hardware
   
               - Fast debugging

                - Check algorithm correctness

Signals in Waveform: 
CLK: System clock - times all operations

reset: Reset signal - initializes system to known state

OUT: Analog DAC output voltage (0-3.3V)

RV_TO_DAC[9:0]: 10-bit digital input to DAC (000-3FF in hex)

How it works: Digital codes → DAC → Analog voltage

POST-SYNTHESIS SIMULATION - Testing gate-level netlist (actual hardware gates)
Why Important: Verify timing after synthesis

              - Check real hardware behaviour

               - Find timing violations

Signals Will Shown:
CLK: Same clock but with real gate delays

reset: Same reset function

OUT: Analog output (same)

D[9:0]: Internal 10-bit data bus (equivalent to RV_TO_DAC)

How it works: Same function but with actual gate delays and timing

Key Difference:
Pre-synth = Ideal timing
Post-synth = Real hardware timing with delays ⏱️
