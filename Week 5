🏗️ Floorplanning

Floorplanning defines the physical canvas for the chip — deciding how much space the design needs, where major blocks go, and how power and signals will be distributed.
This step transforms the synthesized netlist into a spatial layout framework that the placer and router can work with.

🔹 Key Considerations:
Die Size: Determines the total silicon area of the chip.
Core Utilization: Typically 70–85%; balancing area efficiency with routing flexibility.
Macro Placement: Large pre-designed modules (e.g., memories, PLLs) are positioned to reduce long interconnects.
I/O Pins: Positioned around the die boundary to interface with external connections.
Aspect Ratio: Maintains the balance between chip width and height for manufacturability.

🔹 Physical Support Structures:
Tap Cells: Ensure electrical well-tie integrity.
Endcap Cells: Protect rows from edge effects.
PDN (Power Distribution Network): Establishes a grid of metal straps for uniform power delivery.
Blockages: Define regions to avoid routing or placement.
Floorplanning is like city planning — it allocates neighborhoods (macros, logic regions) and roads (routing channels) before construction begins.

🧩 Placement
Once the floorplan is set, the placement stage arranges all the standard cells within the defined core area.

🎯 Main Goals:
Optimize Wirelength: Place connected cells close to each other to minimize delay and power.
Ensure Timing Closure: Respect setup/hold constraints and maintain logical connectivity.
Reduce Congestion: Evenly distribute cells to simplify the routing stage.

🪜 Stages of Placement:
Global Placement
Performs rough optimization to minimize total interconnect length.
Cells may overlap at this stage as the algorithm prioritizes wirelength.
Uses analytical or partitioning-based algorithms.

Detailed Placement
Legalizes placement by snapping cells to rows and removing overlaps.
Maintains alignment with the power grid.

Refines local adjustments to further optimize timing.

After placement, OpenROAD generates reports for timing, wirelength, and congestion — ensuring that the design is physically feasible before moving on to Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) and Routing.
