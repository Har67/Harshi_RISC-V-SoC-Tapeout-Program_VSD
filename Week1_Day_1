WEEK 1 #DAY 1 

Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

DESIGN - A actual verilog code "THE PRODUCT" we are building.

TB -  This is also Verilog code, but its purpose is to "Test the design".
a - Stimulas generator applies diffrent input combo to your design
b - Stimulas observer ,it checks if the output from the design are what we expected.

Iverilog simulates - Software tool that takes both the design & tb and complies them and runs simulation .

Yoysys - Converts our RTL verilog code into actual gates from the Sky130 library.
